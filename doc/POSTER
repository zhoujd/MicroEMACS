	Following up this will be eight notes which are shar'ed parts of
MicroEMACS 3.6. I have been working on this version since I downloaded
Dave Conroy's version which had been ported to the Amiga last November.
As the accompanying documentation stated, this version works and has
been tested on UNIX V7, BSD 4.2, Amiga, MS-DOS, and VMS. I will be
supporting this version and looking to expand it in the near future for
other machines.

[ The previous version of MicroEMACS that was posted to mod.sources was
  MicroEMACS version 20 from Dave Conroy.  Both that version and this
  version of MicroEMACS are based on the original work by Dave Conroy,
  but these two programmers went in different directions.  I hope one day
  that these two development branches merge, but that may be as likely
  as BSD and USG UNIXes merging!  Perhaps the best we can hope for is
  that the best features of each migrate into the other
