The original MicroEMACS
=======================

MicroEMACS is a tool for creating and changing documents, programs, and
other text files.  It is both relatively easy for the novice to use, but
also very powerful in the hands of an expert.  MicroEMACS can be
extensively customized for the needs of the individual user.

MicroEMACS allows several files to be edited at the same time.  The
screen can be split into different windows and screens, and text may be
moved freely from one window on any screen to the next.  Depending on the
type of file being edited, MicroEMACS can change how it behaves to make
editing simple.  Editing standard text files, program files and word
processing documents are all possible at the same time.


History
-------

The development of MicroEMACS by Mr Conroy stopped fairly early on but
Steve Wilhite and George Jones made fixes in the latter half of the 80s
when porting it to the Amiga and released their changes back to the
public domain.  Brian Straight wrote a MicroEMACS manual in 1987, and we
ended up with a collection of patches in 1988 bundled with Straight's
manual that was referred to as "Version 3".  That same year Daniel
M. Lawrence (1958 - 2010) started issuing patches that he named as 3.x
branches.
